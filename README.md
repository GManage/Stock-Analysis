# Green Energy Stock-Analysis

Stock Analysis of Green Energy stocks and their performance over a specified year

## Overview of Project
* The purpose of this analysis is to help see which green stocks would possibly be the wisest to invest in due to their performance in a specified year 
* The analysis will break down the data into a more concise version and to reveal which stock had the greatest returns over a specified year

## Analysis and Results
  * Previously the Stock dataset given was too broad and needed to be broken down for a better and more efficient analysis.
  * The original script that was created only used the year 2018 but showed gave the information that was needed. 
  * While writing the script for refactoring the stock analysis I ran into an issue with how to count the first row and last row but found some code on stackoverflow   that helped with finding whether the first or last rows contain a specific ticker, Refer to link below:

## Summary
  * What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
      - Advantages
  * How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
      -	There are a few pros and cons of refactoring my original VBA script. Firstly, it is quite tedious to rewrite the code. So there is a loss in time but that is usually the case for making something more convenient for the future. This script is now more dynamic and offers more automation. Multiple worksheets can be used. You are not confined to one year as the first script is, which means this can be used for future stock analyses by just using new yearly data.
