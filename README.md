# Green Energy Stock-Analysis

Stock Analysis of Green Energy stocks and their performance over a specified year

## Overview of Project
* The purpose of this project is to help see which green stocks would possibly be the wisest to invest in due to their performance in a specified year 

## Analysis and Results
  * The analysis was made by examining a large dataset of various types of kickstarter campaign data which included; the type of campaign, the goal and date of the campaign, how many backers, what country the campaign was launched in, etc.
  * The first part of the analysis turned out to be a challenge. After figuring out which campaigns were successful, I wanted to figure out why they were successful and if there were any trends I could easily see or isolate that correlated to its success.
  * The challenge that quickly arose, was that a lot of the data needed to be extrapolated so that clearer trends can be seen through the amount of money backers were willing to give, when they willing to give and to specifically what type (category) of campaign they gave to.
